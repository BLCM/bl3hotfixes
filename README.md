BL3 Hotfix Archive
==================

This is an archive of the hotfixes which are being sent to Borderlands 3.
The first hotfix data was manually collected on September 21, 2019, and
the next few after that were collected manually as well.  Starting on
October 1, 2019, this project was created to check the hotfix data every
hour and write out the hotfixes automatically.

The hotfixes are written twice: once to a brand-new file which includes
a datestamp, and once to `hotfixes_current.json`.

The script which does this is written in Python 3, and should run anywhere
Python does, though you'll need to edit `output_dir` inside the script
itself to have it save out files properly.  Check `requirements.txt` inside
the script dir for the extra Python modules needed for it to run.
