Point-in-Time Hotfixes
======================

This directory contains files which have *all* the hotfixes which were
active at the specified time, as shown in the filename.  If you're
looking for just the currently-active hotfixes, you'll be more interested
in `hotfixes_current.json` from the parent directory, though the last
file in here should be the same.
