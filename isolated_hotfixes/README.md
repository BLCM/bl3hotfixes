These could obviously be extracted just from the history of
`hotfixes_current.json`, or diffs between the individual hotfix
files, but I thought it might be useful to canonically extract some
of the more notable changes, such as the 10-Year Anniversary events.

So, here they are.

Notes
-----

- The initial version of the hotfixes for the Week 3 event ("Show Me the
  Eridium") had a couple of errors.  The hotfixes as-delivered are stored
  in the file with `-original` in the filename.  I've also saved a version
  which is almost certainly the hotfixes that were *intended* to have been
  released, with `-fixed` in the filename.  Time will tell if the official
  hotfixes will get patched or not.
