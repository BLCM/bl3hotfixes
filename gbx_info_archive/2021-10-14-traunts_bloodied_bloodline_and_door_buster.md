Today’s changes to Borderlands 3 activate two exciting events! It kicks off the first of Maurice’s Community Carnage Challenges: Traunt’s Bloodied Bloodline and the Door Buster Mini-Event returns! For Traunt’s Bloodied Bloodline, the community needs to kill Captain Traunt (found on Athenas), General Traunt (found on Nekrotafeyo), and Captain Haunt (found in Heck, which can only be accessed while you’ve activated the Bloody Harvest event via the main menu) a collective total of 500,000 times for a special Vault Hunter Head reward, unlocked via a SHiFT code that will be added to the Maurice’s Community Carnage Challenges article!

Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine will be moving to a new location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a hotfix.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

- Activating the first of Maurice’s Community Carnage Challenges: Traunt’s Bloodied Bloodline until 8:59 AM PT on October 21
- Activating the Door Buster Mini-Event! A single Legendary item will spawn in each vending machine instead of an Item of the Day. This mini-event will end at 8:59 AM PT on October 21
