Today, Bloody Harvest returns to Borderlands 3, and with it comes weapon balance changes and adjustments to Zane the Operative! These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

With the return of Bloody Harvest comes haunted enemies and Terror, a frightening status effect that will leave Vault Hunters a little shaken up! Haunted enemies can inflict the Terror debuff, which will affect your aim and partially cloud your vision—but could leave you with a boost of power when paired with the Anointments that will only be available during the event! The landscape of Borderlands 3 has changed since last year, and with that, the Terror anointments are also receiving some balance changes today.

Players who don’t want to see haunted enemies are able to turn off the Bloody Harvest event in the Main Menu.

- Activates Bloody Harvest, which will be active from October 8 to November 5 at 9:00 AM PT
- Oletta will now consistently lead players to the Traitor Weed testing area in the Bounty of Blood DLC
- Using the Galaxy Brain Mayhem Modifier will no longer prevent players from talking to Krieg or entering the loot room in the Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck DLC

Changes to Zane, the Operative
------------------------------

Today we're releasing several changes to Zane's passive skills and class mods. After buffing weapons, we started looking at how class mods were impacting the build diversity of the Vault Hunters. After investigating community feedback, we developed these changes to make more class mods viable for Zane in the end game. Most of the passive skill buffs changed today are used by class mods that had been underperforming. Additional changes to Zane are already planned, with some coming in future hotfixes and patches.

Skill Changes
-------------

**Cold Bore**

- Increased bonus damage
- This skill only provides extra damage on the first bullet of a weapon swap. This bonus happens infrequently by nature, so we have massively buffed the damage. With this change, we are interested to see new builds centered around small magazine sizes, sniper rifles, and more.

**Duct Tape Mod**

- Decreased grenade cooldown by half
- We found that the value of this passive skill was limited by the cooldown between each grenade, so we've cut that in half. Players will need to be conscious of the cooldown time and type of grenade mod they equipped to get maximum value out of this passive skill. 

**Like a Ghost**

- Increased chance to ignore a bullet
- Increased the bonus for each active action skill
- The stacking bonus only occurs each time one of Zane’s action skills is activated. This is infrequent in the late game, as players generally extend their action skill duration time. We’ve made this change with that play style in mind. 

**Trick of the Light**

- Increased damage bonus
- The damage from this skill depends on the number of enemies targeting Zane and Zane’s clone and can occasionally be unpredictable. To better account for this inconsistency we've buffed the damage bonus.

**Best Served Cold**

- Increased damage from the Cryo novas

**Frutility Belt**

- Increased the damage reduction
- To help encourage players to consider builds that remove elemental damage, we’ve buffed the damage mitigation to be stronger here.

Class Mod Changes
-----------------

**Anti-Freeze**

- Increased movement speed while taking Cryo damage

**Conductor**

- Increased the damage bonus
- The damage bonus for this class mod is dependent on the amount of action skill duration time you have left. Like Trick of the Light, this damage can feel inconsistent. We have increased the damage bonus to provide more reliable damage.

**Executor**

- Increased stat bonuses
- Players suggested that the stat bonuses provided as a kill skill weren't strong enough to feel the value. We've buffed each significantly.

**Techspert**

- Increased the chance of recharge to SNTNL cooldown’s and active duration
- The intent of this class mod is to provide a way to keep Zane's drone active nearly indefinitely, but at just 5% chance to refill the cooldown and duration, it wasn't consistent enough. We've increased the likelihood of this behavior occurring.
