We are releasing a few adjustments to Borderlands 3 as a result of feedback from today’s patch. We’ve updated a couple of weapons that weren’t receiving previous buffs and addressed some Vault Card 2 gear that was not behaving as intended. [1/2]

- Updated the DNA, Lucians Call, and Queen/Kings Call to receive their intended weapon adjustments.
- Lowered the bonus drop chance effect on the Shlooter artifact.
- Lowered the bonus on the Goldrush to 100% and lowered the buff duration to 10 seconds.
[2/2]
