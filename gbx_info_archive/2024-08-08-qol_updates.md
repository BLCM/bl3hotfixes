Today we will release an update for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT.

The update contains these quality-of-life features: 

- Players are now able to create a Max Level Character from the main menu once they have beaten the game and have at least one max level character!
- Added an option to auto-sell gear based on rarity from the main menu:
- This auto-sell feature automatically sells gear below your set rarity when picked up. Cosmetics will not auto-sell.
- A note for Mission Gear: Once a mission has ended, any mission reward items offered as a pickup could be automatically sold if auto-sell is enabled. Before completing a mission, the auto-sell option can be set to "None" to avoid possibly losing a mission reward.
- On Steam Deck: Increased font size of text in the Options Menu.
