Today in Borderlands 3, we are activating the Mayhem Made Mild mini-event! These changes and the accompanying event will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PDT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says “Hotfixes Applied”! If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

The Mayhem Made Mild event, which will be live with today’s hotfixes, will change which modifiers can be rolled in Mayhem Mode! During the event, only “Easy” modifiers will be showing up in Mayhem, regardless of Mayhem level. This event will be live until September 3 at 9:00 AM PDT, when it will switch to the Making It Rain mini-event with next week’s hotfixes!
