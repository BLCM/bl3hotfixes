 Posted: Apr 30 2020

Today we will release a hotfix for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. In this week’s hotfixes, Loot the Universe starts on Promethea, and we address drop rates in Mayhem Mode and concerns reported by the community. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says “Hotfixes Applied”!

Thank you to everyone who has already jumped into Revenge of the Cartels and experimented with Mayhem 2.0! We’ve been closely monitoring feedback and are aware of some stability issues and concerns as a result of the April 23 patch. Since then, we’ve released additional hotfixes to temporarily disable two resource-intensive Mayhem Modifiers, Boundary Issues and Drone Ranger, and have already seen substantial improvements to performance and stability. We are continuing to focus our efforts on addressing your concerns. Today’s adjustments to drop rates and Anointment rates are another step toward incorporating community feedback. If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide additional feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

**The Co-Op Loot Drop ends today at 9:00 AM PT!**

The Loot the Universe mini-event is moving across the galaxy to Promethea! Jump onto the planet until May 7 at 9:00 AM PT, when it changes to Eden-6.

If you’ve noticed a potential concern that has affected you that is not addressed in this update, please send us your data! Many factors are at work and collecting info from a variety of folks can go a long way to help us find commonalities, identify the root cause, and address confirmed issues.

The best way to get us your data would be to open a support ticket and include the following information:

1. Summary of the issue.
2. Frequency of the issue – how often is this happening?
3. The platform you’re playing on (PS4, PS4 Pro, XB1, XB1X, PC). If PC, include a dxdiag log and crash dump.
4. Your game state when you experienced the issue: (map, mission, character, player level, True Vault Hunter playthrough, single-player vs. multiplayer, offline vs. online, etc.)
5. Do you know the steps to make this problem happen again? What are they?
