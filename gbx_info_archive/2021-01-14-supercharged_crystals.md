Today in Borderlands 3, we’re setting off the Supercharged Crystals mini-event and making some adjustments to gear! These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

During the Supercharged Crystals mini-event, players will find that moving off the platform will not reduce the charge of the crystals in the Takedown at the Guardian Breach. As crystals do not lose charge, players cannot wipe during these crystal charge-up sequences. This event will end on January 21 at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET.

* Activates the Supercharged Crystals Mini-Event until January 21 at 9:00 AM PT.
