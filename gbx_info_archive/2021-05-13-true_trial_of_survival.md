Posted: May 13 2021

Today’s changes to Borderlands 3 activate the True Trials event for the Trial of Survival and adjust various pieces of gear. During this event, the Trial of Survival boss has received a HUGE boost to its health and the damage it will be dishing out to players. This mini-event cannot be turned off, so new players beware!

As a reminder, Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine will be moving to a new location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a hotfix. This week’s gear has a special appearance of a piece of gear from the first Borderlands 3 add-on. As a reminder, players are unable to equip an add-on’s gear if they do not yet own the add-on it comes from.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

* Activating the True Trial of Survival event, which will be active until May 20 at 8:59 AM PT

As a reward, the boss will be dropping two Legendary weapons. Each drop has a chance of being either The Lob or the Lucky 7 from the Moxxi’s Heist of The Handsome Jackpot add-on (Note: You must own the Moxxi’s Heist of The Handsome Jackpot add-on to be able to equip its gear).

In addition, the chest at the end of the Trial of Survival will be full of Legendaries regardless of how quickly you completed it or how many objectives you scored!
