To help mend the Broken Hearts that some players had while trying to claim rewards, we’ve put out a little update that loads the Loot Hearts with Broken Hearts Day weapons. As a special bonus, we’re making sure you see more of those hearts!

The level of Broken Hearts Day weapons will be the same as any other pieces of dropped gear! If you haven’t redeemed your rewards from the event screen, those will now be redeeming at your current level.
