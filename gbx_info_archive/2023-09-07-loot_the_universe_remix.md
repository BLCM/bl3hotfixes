=======================

(Just taking the relevant excerpt -- that page goes into detail on a number of related events.  The only hotfix-specific changes is the "Loot the Universe Remix" section).

Get ready to farm Legendary loot like a fiend, because the Loot the Universe series of mini-events is coming back to Borderlands 3 for a limited time!

Each week from September 7 to October 5, two planets in Borderlands 3—one from the base game and one from add-on content—will have greatly increased drop chances for certain types of Legendary loot within specific, undisclosed locations. For example, you'll find different kinds of Legendary loot in the Meridian Metroplex versus Atlas HQ during Promethea's week of Loot the Universe.

It'll be up to the Borderlands community to collectively figure out each week's hotspots and chase after the most coveted pieces of loot. As before, each planet's affected zones have their own dedicated Legendary weapon type (Pistol, Shotgun, SMG, Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle, or Heavy), and may also have increased chances for Legendary gear types (Class Mods, Artifacts, Shields, or Grenade Mods).

Here's the schedule for which planets will be affected during which week once each week's small hotfix has been deployed:

- Week 1 (9 AM PT September 7 to 8:59 AM PT September 14) - Eden-6 and Gehenna
- Week 2 (9 AM PT September 14 to 8:59 AM PT September 21) - Promethea and The Handsome Jackpot
- Week 3 (9 AM PT September 21 to 8:59 AM PT September 28) - Pandora and Xylourgos
- Week 4 (9 AM PT September 28 to 8:59 AM PT October 5) - Nekrotafeyo and Krieg's Mind
