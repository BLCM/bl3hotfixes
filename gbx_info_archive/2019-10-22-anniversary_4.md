We're continuing to celebrate Borderlands' 10-year anniversary with another week of in-game bonuses for Borderlands 3. This week is Mayhem on Twitch!

As the month-long Borderlands Anniversary Celebration nears its final week and Bloody Harvest draws near, we're bringing a double dose of bonuses to Borderlands 3. This week's event, Mayhem on Twitch, rewards players and viewers alike as Mayhem Mode and the Borderlands 3 ECHOcast Extension get kicked up a notch.

Mayhem on Twitch will begin courtesy of a quick micropatch deploying by or before 3:00 PM PDT on Tuesday, October 22. You'll receive an in-game notification if you're playing while the micropatch goes live; to ensure that the micropatch is successfully applied, verify that you're online then hang around the main menu for a minute or two.

For the duration of the event, players who enable Mayhem Mode will see an increased drop chance for Anointed gear, increased XP gains, and reduced values for various Mayhem Mode penalty modifiers. Meanwhile, viewers and streamers on Twitch will enjoy the mayhem of amped-up ECHOcast features. Badass Viewer Events will happen more often as we tweaked how those are triggered (this is a permanent change, too!), and we've accelerated voting periods during the event to make these viewers-controlled badasses even more of a challenge. In addition, Rare Chest Events will have a 100% guaranteed win rate this week instead of the usual one-in-four chance.

As a reminder, Mayhem Mode can only be enabled once you've finished Borderlands 3's main story campaign, which unlocks a special console aboard Sanctuary III. In contrast, earning rewards through ECHOcast requires almost no effort; all you need to do is link your SHiFT and Twitch accounts. Even if you don't own Borderlands 3, you can still take part in the fun. Any rewards you score via Rare Chest Events will be waiting for you in your in-game mailbox whenever you jump into Borderlands 3. Here's a step-by-step guide to linking your SHiFT and Twitch accounts:

- If you don't have a SHiFT account, you can set one up for free at the Gearbox SHiFT site.
- If you don't have a Twitch account, you can set one up for free by heading over to Twitch and using the "Sign Up" link at the top of the page.
- Linking your accounts is easy. Visit the settings tab on your SHiFT profile page by clicking the little gear icon, click on the Twitch logo under "Connections," and follow the onscreen instructions to link your account. Alternatively, sign in to your SHiFT account over at the Gearbox SHiFT site, click on "Gaming Platforms" on the left, and then click on the "Link" option under the Twitch logo. You can also click the "SHiFT Account Link" button under the Events tab within the ECHOcast extension itself to navigate to the SHiFT site and link your accounts if you haven't done so already.

Mayhem on Twitch will run from October 22 to October 29 when the final week's theme begins. The Borderlands Anniversary Celebration calendar is below—and if you want to know what this month of Borderlands 3 bonuses is all about, you can catch up here.

Week 5 (October 29 - November 4): Spooky Surprise!

Whether you spend this week braving Mayhem Mode yourself or enjoying the ECHOcast Extension on Twitch as a viewer, the Mayhem on Twitch event should deliver a bevy of white-knuckle battles against badass enemies. If you're an ECHOcast-enabled Twitch streamer yourself, stay vigilant—there's no telling how chaotic those badass encounters will get when your viewers start buffing these baddies without mercy.
