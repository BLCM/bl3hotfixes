With today’s changes in Borderlands 3, we are turning on the Show Me the Eridium event! This event should help you prepare for the various uses for Eridium coming next week.

As we continue to test around the upcoming raid content with Director’s Cut, we’ve made some balance changes in today’s update to Borderlands 3 where we were able to confirm community suspicions of huge outliers in damage being dealt. We have adjusted various gear, skills, and Mayhem Scaling to prepare players for the launch of the raid boss in the Director’s Cut add-on that’s dropping next week! We’re also continuing to monitor player feedback.

Today’s changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

- Activates the Show Me the Eridium Event! This event will be live until April 8 at 8:59 AM PT!
- Prevent Artifacts from dropping for players before they unlock at level 27 in Arms Race
- Increased the chance for Legendary Gear to appear in the Golden Chest on Sanctuary III
- Lowered the amount of damage being passed along to passive skills that use Mayhem Scaling in Mayhem 6 and above
  - Passive Skills that have Mayhem Scaling enabled have created very spikey moments in our damage pipeline. These spikes are far outside the bounds of normal damage. Balancing content around these spikes would have removed build diversity and forced players into very specific and specialized builds. That is counter to our goals of always increasing diversity, so we’ve changed the scaling accordingly.
- Implemented a stacking cap of two on the Operative’s Commitment skill to bring it in line with similar skills and prevent excessive stacking
  - The intent for this skill was always to stack as many times as Zane’s other Kill Skills, which is twice. When its increased stacking was discovered last fall, we determined we would leave it as it wasn’t causing catastrophic issues. As part of balancing for the upcoming content however, we have deemed it necessary for the stacks to be capped as originally designed.
- Decreased the damage bonus on the Gunner’s Short Fuse skill from 75% to 50%
- Increased the damage done by skills using the Siren’s Phasecast and Phaseslam:
  - Phasecast – Cast damage increased by 5%
  - Deliverance bonus increased by 5%
  - Reverberation bonuses increased by 10%
  - Tandava bonus damage increased by 10%
  - Phaseslam – Slam damage increased by 10%
  - Fracture damage bonus increased to 35%
  - Downfall bonus increased to 10%
  - Based on community feedback, we are adding some power back into Amara’s Action Skills to offset some of the damage that has been removed from specific pieces of gear. We’ll continue to monitor her and will make more changes as needed.
- Lowered the damage bonus on the Guardian Perk Groundbreaker from 25% to 10%
