Enjoy Borderlands 3 with your pals and earn more loot during the Co-op Loot Drop event and more!

If you're looking for a way to connect during these strange times, games are a fantastic way to socialize even when we have to be apart. Right now, you might be deep into Borderlands 3's latest campaign add-on, Guns, Love, and Tentacles: The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock, or tearing up Maliwan's forces during the ongoing Takedown Shakedown event. But if you're looking for even more ways to play together remotely over the coming weeks, we've got just the thing. Starting today, we're kicking off the Co-op Loot Drop event that gives you some sweet incentives to play Borderlands 3 with your co-op buddies.

Co-op Loot Drop will switch on via a hotfix today, and is scheduled to run through the full month of April. During the Co-op Loot Drop, all Badass enemies will drop more loot whenever you're playing co-op. It's that simple!

In addition, weâ€™ll be layering shorter events on top of the Co-op Loot Drop all month long. First up, we'll be trying out a new Door Busters mini-event, where Legendary items will be hiding among the usual fare for sale in vending machines across the galaxy. Door Busters will run from today until next Thursday, April 2 at 8:59 AM PT when it will be replaced with another event or two on top of the ongoing Co-op Loot Drop bonuses. Our goal is to give you something surprising and exciting each week, so be sure to check back.

We're also sending everyone the themed seasonal items from the previous Bloody Harvest and Holiday events (including a level 57 version of the Juliet's Dazzle Legendary Assault Rifle) for anyone who might've missed them the first time around. Look for them in your in-game mailbox when you log in before 8:59 AM PT on April 30. Oh, and one more thing: here's a SHiFT code for a whopping 10 Golden Keys. Make sure to redeem this SHiFT code here on Borderlands.com, on the Gearbox SHiFT site, or via the in-game Social menu in Borderlands 3 before it deactivates on April 10 at 11:59 PM PT.*

We hope you're all staying safe and healthy, and that Borderlands 3 provides some mayhem-filled bonding even with everything else that's going on. The Co-op Loot Drop, plus this series of surprise events over the coming weeks, will roll us into the Mayhem Mode 2.0 endgame overhaul and the Revenge of the Cartels seasonal event we showed off during The Borderlands Show Episode 6. Whenever you need a break from the real world, we invite you to come play together on Pandora and the planets beyond.

*Borderlands 3 and SHiFT account required to redeem. Each code may be redeemed once (1) per SHiFT account.
