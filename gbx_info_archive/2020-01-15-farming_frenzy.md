Rare Spawns and increased loot drops abound during our limited-time Borderlands 3 Farming Frenzy!

Are you ready to get your farm on, Vault Hunter? No, not the turd farming of Typhon DeLeon's resourceful ancestry—we're talking about battling bosses and unique enemies to earn some of Borderlands 3's best loot. During a limited-time mini-event we've dubbed Farming Frenzy, you can take advantage of increased drop rates and Rare Spawns showing up more often from January 16 to January 30.

For the next two weeks, you'll have extra incentive to farm enemies with dedicated loot drops. That includes repeatable bosses from the main story campaign, Proving Grounds and Circle of Slaughter arenas, and the Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite, as well as named enemies including Rare Spawns, Hammerlock Hunts, and Targets of Opportunity. All these distinct, deadly baddies will be more likely to drop Legendary items from their respective loot pools—and as an added bonus, the Anointment rate for dropped gear has also been temporarily increased!

To help you track down your desired targets, Rare Spawn enemies will show up more often for the duration of the event. If you've been chasing after some of Borderlands 3's most sought-after Legendary drops and Anointed items, this is the time to jump in and score the loot that'll make your dream Vault Hunter build a reality.

The Farming Frenzy mini-event will commence on all platforms via a hotfix on Thursday, January 16 at 9:00 AM PST and will conclude when another hotfix deploys on Thursday, January 30 at 8:59 AM PST. That's the same timeframe as the scaling Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite event, which will be active on PlayStation®4, Xbox One, and PC where the Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite is available. To apply hotfixes, simply wait at the main menu until you see a "Hotfixes Applied" sign appear on the post behind your Vault Hunter.

Enjoy all the new additions to your arsenal over the next two weeks as the Farming Frenzy brings a bountiful crop of impressive loot drops!
