Grab new cosmetic goodies and take part in a pair of two-day mini-events in honor of Borderlands 3's second anniversary!

Fire those virtual guns in the air and do an emote dance if the spirit moves you, Vault Hunterâ€”Borderlands 3 turns two today! To put the Borderlands 3 Second Anniversary Celebration over the top, we've got some party favors in the form of limited-time mini-events and new goodies you can grab via SHiFT codes!

First up, let's talk mini-events. For the next 48 hours, ending at 8:59 AM PT on September 15, we're bringing back Loot Monster Mayhem, which gives increased spawn rates for Loot variant enemies. As an extra bonus, we're adding the Hammerlock's Legendary Hunts reward Bekah Assault Rifle and the Earworm Assault Rifle from 2019's Boss Week to the loot pool! When you're not blowing up enemies and collecting loot over the next two days, seek out Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine hidden somewhere in the wilderness so you can grab a few Legendary freebies courtesy of everyone's favorite Saurian.

These celebratory mini-events only last a limited-time, but we're also giving out cosmetic gifts you can keep in your collection forever! Rock some resplendent rainbow ice cream cake colors with the shared Popsychle Vault Hunter Skin, check out the Pain Freeze Weapon Trinket capturing the schadenfreude of a gumball-eyed frozen treat forever stuck in mid-melt, and pay homage to Marcus' magic kill bus with the Field Trip ECHO Device Skin.

All three of these cosmetic items can be yours with the SHiFT code below! You can redeem this SHiFT code here on Borderlands.com, on the Gearbox SHiFT site, or via the in-game Social menu in Borderlands 3. Borderlands 3 and SHiFT account required to redeem. Each code may be redeemed once (1) per SHiFT account.

And now, for the grand finale: a time-limited SHiFT code for a Diamond Key! Consider it your ticket to the Diamond Chest and a room full of mouthwatering loot aboard Sanctuary III. If you're not sure what Diamond Keys are or how they work, be sure to check out our Vault Card and Diamond Keys guide. This is also an extremely rare chance to get a Diamond Key you can redeem and use even if you don't own the Director's Cut add-on!

Make sure to redeem this SHiFT code here on Borderlands.com, Gearbox SHiFT site, or via the in-game Social menu in Borderlands 3 before it deactivates on September 27 at 11:59 PM PT. Borderlands 3 and SHiFT account required to redeem. Each code may be redeemed once (1) per SHiFT account.

Even after the two-day Loot Monster Mayhem and Maurice's Black Market Machine freebies events end at 8:59 AM PT on September 15, that still leaves one more day to enjoy the ongoing Mayhem Made Mild (only Easy modifiers in Mayhem Mode) and Show Me the Eridium (increased Eridium drops and Eridium item discounts) mini-events before they end at 8:59 AM PT on September 16. We hope you're enjoying our second birthday bash and cherish those sweet cosmetics in your virtual gift bag!
