Today’s changes to Borderlands 3 activate the Loot the Universe event on Nekrotafeyo as part of the Borderlands 3 Second Anniversary Celebration. Each week during Loot the Universe, Borderlands 3’s planets will take turns of having even better drops, with specific types of Legendary loot having increased chance of dropping in one of that planet’s zones.

Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine will be moving to a new location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a hotfix.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

- Activated the Loot the Universe mini-event on Nekrotafeyo until 8:59 AM PT on September 9
