Posted: May 4 2022 (updated periodically as the events are made live and rewards unlocked)

Rise up, Vault Hunters, for a month of exciting community challenges! Band together to achieve them with the rest of the Borderlands 3 community, and you’ll unlock an all-new selection of four Vault Hunter Heads and four Weapon Trinkets for everyone to enjoy. Don't assume these challenges will be easy, though; the Maliwan bosses you need to defeat each week are significantly stronger than normal, so soloing them won’t be an option for all but the most powerful of endgame builds. 

The first of four planned Maliwan May Mayhem community challenge events commences on May 5 at 9:00 AM PT. Participation is as simple as following the in-game objective presented each week both in this article and on the official Borderlands Twitter account (which is also where we'll be posting occasional progress updates).

Once a Maliwan May Mayhem community challenge is successfully completed, we'll share out a SHiFT code in this article that will grant the new Vault Hunter Head and Weapon Trinket rewards! You can redeem the revealed SHiFT codes here on Borderlands.com, on the Gearbox SHiFT site, or via the in-game Social menu in Borderlands 3. Borderlands 3 and SHiFT account required to redeem. Each code may be redeemed once (1) per SHiFT account.

Challenge 1 - Attack the Mind

Head down to the Halcyon Spaceport on Promethea and hack apart this fleshy meatputer. Yes, your first challenge is to defeat the giant nerd known as Gigamind a collective total of 50,000 times.

To complete the third of this month's community challenges, find Katagawa Jr. in the Atlas HQ on Promethea and defeat him a collective total of 50,000 times.

Rounding out our month of Maliwan-themed Mayhem is a community challenge that's sure to put your skills (and perhaps any gear you've collected during previous challenges) to the test. You guessed it—it's time to complete the Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite. A total of 50,000 successful missions will complete this challenge, during which the final boss Wotan the Invincible will have an increased chance to drop a wide range of Legendary weapons manufactured by Maliwan!
