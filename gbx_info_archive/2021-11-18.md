Today we will release an update for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. This update adds the third and final Vault Card for players who own the Director’s Cut content, adds a toggle for the True Trials event effects, activates the limited-time Co-op Loot Drop event ending on November 25 at 8:59 AM PT, and addresses various reported concerns!

Update Notes
------------

**New Content**

- Vault Card 3: Bunker Masters has been added to the game for owners of the Director’s Cut add-on
- Added a switch to the Proving Ground maps that will enable the True Trials event for players
  - Dev Note: Be sure to use the switch prior to starting the mission for the trial. Once the mission has started, the switch cannot be used again until the mission has been failed or the Proving Ground map is reloaded. The loot changes on each boss just as it did during the original True Trials events.
- Added 3 new ECHO Device Skin customizations to Crazy Earl’s Shop

**General**

- Updated Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine to switch locations without relying on a weekly hotfix
  - Dev Note: Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine has many weeks of new items that will be randomly selected, interspersed between previous weeks’ selections. Weekly gear sets will not be reused until all the available weekly selections have been used, at which point the selection list will be reset and randomly selected from again. There are 52 weeks of selections, so make sure to purchase any piece of gear you see, as you won’t see it again for at least one year!
