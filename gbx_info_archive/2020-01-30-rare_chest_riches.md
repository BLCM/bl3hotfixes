- Addressed a reported issue that the player could sometimes rise into the sky with the cannon during the "One Man's Treasure" mission in Moxxi's Heist of The Handsome Jackpot

TRUE TAKEDOWN MODE
------------------

We've been looking at the feedback we received during the Scaling Event for Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite and have decided to make this Scaled event permanent starting today.

In a February update, we will include a new switch to re-enable what we call True Takedown Mode. True Takedown Mode will restore the Takedown to the 4-player experience that it launched with for extra difficulty. Once implemented, a lever activating True Takedown Mode will be located on the right side of the door leading out of the airlock at the beginning of the map.

RARE SPAWNS AND DROP RATES
--------------------------

Once the Farming Frenzy event is over, we are implementing a permanent change to the Rare Spawns and Drop Rates. After analyzing play patterns, we are permanently increasing the spawn rate for these enemies and have buffed their drop rates and their Anointed chance to be on par with bosses.

RARE CHEST RICHES EVENT
-----------------------

When the hotfixes roll out today before 3:00 PM PST, a new event will be activated! During the Rare Chest Riches Event, which runs until February 13 at 8:59am PST, all Rare Chests will drop rare loot at an increased rate, so you're more likely to receive Legendary items any time you open one. This increased drop rate will also apply when you watch a Twitch streamer open a Rare Chest, assuming both of you have the ECHOcast Twitch Extension enabled. Any rewards you score while watching streamers will be waiting for you in your in-game mailbox the next time you play Borderlands 3.

The Rare Chest Riches event will also apply to the Stadia version of Borderlands 3.
