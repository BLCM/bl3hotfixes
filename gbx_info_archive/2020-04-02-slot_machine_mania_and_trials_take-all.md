 Posted: Apr 2 2020

Today we will release a hotfix for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. This hotfix begins two new events, Slot Machine Mania and Trials Take-All, and includes some buffs to the Gunner, weapons balance, and addressing reported community concerns. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says “Hotfixes Applied”! If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

**The Door Busters mini event ends at 9:00 AM PST today.**

We also are excited to start two new events: Slot Machine Mania and Trials Take-All! They’ll go live with the hotfix today!

**Slot Machine Mania** pays out big time! There’s an increased chance to win Legendary gear from Slot Machines, and for grenades to spawn (because who doesn’t like a little risk?). There’s still a chance for other loot to drop, but the rate has been reduced so you can win Legendaries (and take damage)!

**Trials Take-All** boosts the rewards awarded during the Proving Ground Trials. Bosses will have a 100% chance to drop loot from their pools during the event.

- Activate Slot Machine Mania mini-event until 9:00 AM PT on April 9
- Activate Trials Take-All mini-event until 9:00 AM PT on April 9
- Adjusted the Pearl of Ineffable Knowledge Artifact to do +90% damage and updated the item description to show the correct value
- Addressed a reported concern that the Siren’s Stone class mod was sometimes increasing damage taken, instead of decreasing damage taken

Adjustments for Moze, the Gunner:
---------------------------------

We have been taking a closer at Moze the last few weeks. Here at the first set of hotfixes based on those investigations, primarily focused on improving her survivability. We will be further addressing some areas we identified as trouble spots for her in the future.

- Reduced the cooldown time for Iron Bear
- Increased the amount of fuel for Iron Bear
- Increased the bonus on “Behind the Iron Curtain” skill
- Increased the bonus on “Experimental Munitions” skill

Weapon Balance:
---------------

**Damned**

- Increased weapon damage

**Hyperion Weapon Shields**

- Increased the amount of damage weapon shields absorb

**The Lob**

- Increased Fire Rate
- Reduced projectiles from 3 to 1

**Tiggs Boom**

- Increased weapon damage
- Increased damage from the Starfall meteors

**Moonfire**

- Increased weapon damage
- Increased Critical Damage Bonus

**Good Juju**

- Non-critical hits now increase Critical Damage Bonus by 20%. This bonus stacks 25 times and is removed upon manual reload.

*[An earlier version of these notes incorrectly listed a change to the Security Bear skill. This has been corrected.]*
