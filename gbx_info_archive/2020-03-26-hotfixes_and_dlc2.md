Patch Notes
===========

New Content:
------------

- Added support for Borderlands 3 campaign add-on: Guns, Love, and Tentacles: The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock
- Level Cap increase - New Max Level 57
  - Here it is! Two capstones, everyone!  We’re excited to see what interesting new builds everyone creates with these additional skill points!
- 3 New Guardian Rank skills and Guardian Rank Increase
  - Here are the first 3 new Guardian Rank Perks!  In the Enforcer tree we’ve added “C’mon and Slam,” allowing you to use the slam at any height.  This should make slam gear a lot more interesting.  For the Survivor Tree, you can now enable “Too Angry to Die,” allowing any damage you do to enemies in Fight For Your Life to slightly extend your down time.  Finally, in the Hunter tree we added “Harmageddon,” where additional damage is done to enemies that have received multiple static effects.
- New campaign add-on Game Menus that will allow players to start the campaign add-on with an auto-leveled character
  - You can now immediately jump into new DLC content right from the menu!  You’ll start the game with a character leveled up to where the DLC content would be unlocked, and you can start right in the new content.
- Support for the ECHOcast update and new Moxxtail Events
  - Viewers can show their appreciation for their favorite streamers with Moxxtail Events, which let you convert Twitch Bits into in-game beverages that provide the streamer with various limited-time buffs. We have a full explanation of how they work in our Moxxtail Events guide, so be sure to check that out if you want to dabble in some Borderlands 3 mixology.

Stability
---------

- Addressed memory leaks that occasionally occurred on Split Screen join/leave
- Fixed a crash that could sometimes occur after spending a large amount of Guardian Tokens
- Fixed a crash that could sometimes occur when quickly navigating Crazy Earl’s shop

Performance
-----------

- Optimization improvements
- UI Optimizations

General
-------

- Gear lower than level cap no longer drops when player and enemy characters are each at level cap
  - We saw the community feedback here and agreed that seeing gear below the level cap, when at the level cap, was not an ideal experience. Characters at max level should no longer receive gear at a level lower than their character through chests and drops from enemies that are also at the level cap.
- Added the ability start a campaign add-on with an auto leveled character
- Added support for more Guardian Rank perks
- Re-balanced game stage regions starting from about Act 2 on to better follow the player growth
  - Based on data and community feedback, we have adjusted the leveling experience post-Act 2 to better ensure that enemies are properly leveled to players as they move into the second half of the game. This change will only impact characters created after this patch is live.
