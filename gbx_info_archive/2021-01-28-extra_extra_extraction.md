Today in Borderlands 3, we’re setting off the Extra Extra Extraction mini-event in Arms Race! This mini-event is enabled by a hotfix that will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

This event will end on February 4 at 8:59 AM PT / 11:59 AM ET.

The Clear Skies mini-event in Arms Race will end at 8:59 AM PT with today’s hotfix.
