Get a glimpse of the frightful festivities that await in the free Bloody Harvest event coming to Borderlands 3 on October 24.

Do you feel that chill running up your spine, Vault Hunter? It must be the call of Bloody Harvest, a completely free seasonal event for Borderlands 3 running from October 24 to December 5. Feast your eyes on the ghosts and ghouls you'll be fighting during Bloody Harvest in our new trailer above.

In addition to all the Bloody Harvest info that debuted during the first episode of The Borderlands Show, we'd like to share some more details about how this event will function once it's live. To participate, you'll need to have progressed far enough in the story campaign to have unlocked Sanctuary III, which happens early on. While Bloody Harvest is active, you'll notice a peculiar newcomer aboard your ship: Maurice, a surprisingly friendly Saurian who can speak to you via a device of Tannis' own invention. As Borderlands 3 Creative Director Paul Sage explained during The Borderlands Show, "Maurice is your guide to all of [Borderlands 3's] seasonal events."

Going to Heck
-------------

When Bloody Harvest begins, Maurice will offer you a repeatable mission that must be completed in order to reach Heck, the spooky setting for Borderlands 3's Bloody Harvest. Maurice kindly asks that you collect a certain amount of Hecktoplasm, an item that drops from slain Haunted enemies. You'll encounter Haunted enemies all over the galaxy during Bloody Harvest; you'll know them by their ghostly green glow. Once you've collected enough Hecktoplasm, Maurice will open a portal to Heck aboard Sanctuary III that will transport you to the creepy domain of Captain Haunt and his undead minions.

Once you've managed to stop shaking in your boots at the sheer spookiness of Heck, you'll have to fight your way through an undead army of Maliwan soldiers who are rising from their graves with ambitions of revenge. You'll also encounter freaky fauna including flying, fire-breathing Rakk-o'-Lanterns and wretched Ratch that've gorged themselves on blood. Deep within the depths of Heck lies Captain Haunt, the bony final boss of Bloody Harvest.

Collecting new gear and cosmetics
---------------------------------

Your enemies in Heck have a chance to drop gear that will only be available during Bloody Harvest, including Fearmonger, a new Legendary shotgun that packs a supernatural punch. You might also find Anointed weapons that play off the new Terror mechanic introduced in Bloody Harvest. Haunted enemies can inflict the Terror debuff, which will affect your aim and partially cloud your vision—but with these new Anointed effects, you can turn Terror into a beneficial boost of power.

There's also a set of seasonal cosmetic items which won't drop in Heck, but are still exclusive to the Bloody Harvest event. During the event, you have the chance to earn a skin for each of the four Vault Hunters (which also apply to Moze's mech Iron Bear and Fl4K’s pets), a seasonal ECHO Device Skin, a shrunken head Weapon Trinket, and finally a ghostly Global Weapon Skin, all of which you can check out in the trailer up top.

To unlock these items, you'll need to complete a new set of Challenges that are exclusive to Bloody Harvest. Progress towards completing these Challenges is tracked automatically, and each cosmetic item is unlocked via completing a certain number of these Challenges.

We can't wait for you to visit Heck and take on Captain Haunt when Bloody Harvest begins on October 24. Until then, do your best to steel yourself for the terrifying trials that await you.
