Today we will release a hotfix for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. This week’s hotfixes addressed a perceived progression blocker, while our QA team is hard at work for the patch on June 4! To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says “Hotfixes Applied”! If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

This week, we only have the one hotfix, as testing resources are currently being directed at the upcoming patch on June 4!

- Addressed a reported concern that the “Talk” prompt would sometimes fail to appear during “Pandora’s Next Top Mouthpiece” when playing in multiplayer.
