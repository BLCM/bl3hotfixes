Today’s changes to Borderlands 3 activate the next Community Carnage Challenge and increases sniper rifle damage game wide!

LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONS tasks the community with defeating 20 million enemies with sniper rifles for a special SHiFT reward! Remember, for these kills to count the killing blow must be from the sniper rifle itself and not additional effects (such as damage over time or explosive damage)!

Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine will also be moving to a new location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a hotfix.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

* Activating the second of Maurice’s Community Carnage Challenges: LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONS
* Sniper Rifles
  * Increased Weapon Damage
  * Dev Note: We are applying a flat damage buff to sniper rifles to make them a little more lethal throughout entirety of the game. After these changes have settled, we will look at additional adjustments to unique sniper rifles as necessary.
