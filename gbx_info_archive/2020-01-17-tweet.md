We looked into reports of low drop rates for specific enemies during the #Borderlands3 Farming Frenzy event, and found that some were still dropping rewards at a lower rate than intended. We have since pushed out a hotfix to improve the dedicated loot drops for these bosses:

- Borman Nates
- El Dragon Jr. 
- One Punch
- Anointed Alpha
- The Unstoppable
- Urist Enforcer
- Road Dog
- Tarantella
- Maxitrillion
- Rakkman
