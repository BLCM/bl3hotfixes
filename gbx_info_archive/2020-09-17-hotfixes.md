Today in Borderlands 3, we addressed a reported exploit and comment on the frequency of future changes to the game. These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

- Prevented enemies from indefinitely spawning during Takedown at the Guardian Breach
- Addressed a reported concern that new hotfixes were being added to Borderlands 3 too frequently

After this week, we will be changing the cadence in which we put out new hotfixes. Moving forward, the hotfix schedule will mirror when we put out updates, with exceptions for any emergency adjustments that we feel are necessary to the integrity of the game. The team is working hard on future updates and new content, which we are excited to share with you soon™.
