Posted: Jun 11 2020

Today we will release an update for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST (with the exception of Mac, which is planned to go live on June 18). This update adds the new takedown: Takedown at the Guardian Breach, addresses the first phase of changes to Mayhem 2.0, and addresses some player-reported concerns.

**The seasonal event Revenge of the Cartels officially ends today at 9:00 AM PST!** We hope everyone enjoyed the experience, the music, and the gear! With today’s patch and hotfixes, players will no longer be able to travel to the Villa—until next year! For those worried about the availability of the awesome Anointments that dropped as part of this event, those are here to stay! Make sure that you have your hotfixes applied to ensure that they are part of the pool of potential dropped Anointments! 

To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says “Hotfixes Applied”! If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

Hotfixes
--------

This week, we have a variety of gear balance changes, as promised in the Mayhem 2.0 Dev Update, and hotfixes specifically for Takedown at the Guardian Breach. To get the changes and avoid seeing any of these issues arise, make sure that you have your hotfixes applied at the main menu.

To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says “Hotfixes Applied”! If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

- Added Revenge of the Cartel Anointments to the permanent drop pool for gear
- Addressed a reported concern that spikes from Mantakores and Korax ignored Zane’s Barrier
- Re-balanced the number of enemies active at one time during Takedown at the Guardian Breach
- Re-balanced the health of some enemies during Takedown at the Guardian Breach

- Addressed a concern with the Operative’s SNTNL not targeting enemies in some cases

Weapon Adjustments
------------------

As stated in the patch notes, we have adjusted the Health, Shield, and Armor stats for Mayhem Levels 7 and higher. As part of that change, we need to adjust gear to reflect that. With the decrease in enemy health, shield, and armor in later levels of Mayhem, all the gear you have currently will feel more effective as you take down enemies in those higher levels. SMGs have proven to be one of the most popular weapon types, so we’ve focused on them with this update. We decided that this amount of change was all we were comfortable with when paired with the scaling changes. We will observe player feedback over the coming weeks and likely make further adjustments as needed.

**Weapon Buffs**

The number of viable SMGs felt low, compared to the relative depth of weapons of that type.  As a result, several them have had damage increases this week.

- Increased weapons damage on Bitch
- Increased weapons damage on Handsome Jackhammer
- Increased weapons damage on Devoted
- Increased weapons damage on Cloud Kill
- Increased weapons damage on Tsunami
- Increased weapons damage on Ten Gallon
- Increased melee damage bonus on Ripper
  - The Ripper’s melee damage bonus wasn’t providing enough incentive to execute its intended loop.  We’ve buffed the damage on the melee strike.
- Increased weapon damage on Vanquisher
  - The base damage for the Vanquisher and its bonus damage while sliding have been buffed. Like the Ripper, its core loop wasn’t being used as the slide bonus wasn’t significant enough prior to this change.
- Increased bonus damage while sliding on Vanquisher
  - The Ripper and Vanquisher should be very effective now when embracing their unique loops.

**Weapon Nerfs**

We found that a few pieces of gear were overperforming or not working as intended, which unintentionally pushed players into builds exclusively using them. It also allowed players to bypass the intended growth of moving up the Mayhem Levels over time.  By lowering these values and addressing some data, players should feel able to experiment with other pieces of gear.

**Sandhawk**

The Sandhawk was creating too many particle systems which we found creating issues related to performance. It also was creating too much damage relative to other sniper rifles. To combat this, we’ve made the following changes.

- Increased Shot Cost from 2 to 3 – We’ve increased the cost of firing the weapon, so that players have to more thoughtfully manage ammo.  With the additional SDUs that were added in The Revenge of the Cartels patch, players should still be able to use this weapon quite a bit.
- Removed 2 projectiles – As stated, the performance cost of this weapon was too high, so we’ve removed two particle systems from each shot.  This also removes some damage output from the weapon.
- Increased Accuracy Spread – To make up for the difference for the missing projectiles, we’ve spread out the pattern, so it still covers the same space.
- Lowered lifetime of projectiles – Too many active particle systems from consecutive shots was really hurting performance, so we’ve lowered the lifespan of the projectile.
- Increased projectile speed – It was important to use to keep the weapon still effective in combat, so to counter the lowered lifetime of the projectiles, we’ve sped them up.  The result is a weapon that still feels as effective as before, and even more responsive.

**Yellowcake**

We discovered an unfortunate issue with the Yellowcake that effectively added an extra 100% damage beyond its intended output. We are fixing it today.

- Changed Damage Scaling – The wrong scaling math was applying to the Yellowcake, greatly increasing its damage beyond its intended value.  We are changing it to use intended math.
- Split Projectile Damage Decrease – We are lowering the damage of each of its split projectiles as they were overperforming as well.

**Kaoson**

The Kaoson was providing more power than intended, which made it the go-to SMG.  With today’s changes it should still provide plenty of damage that focuses on explosive damage bonuses, but not quite at the scale as in the past.

- Accuracy Impulse Increased – Its accuracy allowed players to deal pin-point damage, then with the added explosive damage, it was further maximizing output. We are increasing the accuracy impulse to account for the explosive damage bonus better.
- Max Accuracy Increased – At full auto, the spread proved exceedingly tight, again allowing more damage to be maximized than we intended.  We’ve increased the maximum accordingly.
- Critical Damage Reduced – The explosive damage provided by this weapon allows critical hits more frequently, so we are lowering its critical bonus by a small amount.
- Base Damage Decreased – As the Kaoson basically has two points of damage—the initial bullet, and then the explosive round—it was providing way more damage than a typical SMG.  We’re lowering the base damage to better account for its dual damage feature.

**Anointment Buffs**

Several Anointments in the game were not providing enough value, effectively making them non-viable for players.  In an effort to increase build diversity, we are buffing a number of Anointments.

- Airborne Anointments – We’ve increased the effectiveness of the While Airborne Damage, Critical Damage, and Fire Rate Anointment.  The Airborne Fire Rate Anointment had a bug as well, which is being fixed to substantially improve this Anointment.  We’re anxious to see what builds will be used in Takedown at the Guardian Breach in particular.
- Slide Fire Rate – It had a bug as well that prevented it from providing the intended bonus; we’ve resolved that in these hotfixes.
- Action Skill End – A number of these types of Anointments have been buffed to make them more useful for more builds.  Fire Rate, Next 2 Mag Bonus Damage, and Splash Damage have all received damage increases.
- Auto Bear Active Incendiary Damage – This has received a significant buff to make Iron Bear builds more effective.
