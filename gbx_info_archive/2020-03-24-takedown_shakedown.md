Get more Takedown boss loot during the Takedown Shakedown event in Borderlands 3.

Guns, Love, and Tentacles: The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock launches this Thursday, March 26, bringing the all-new ice world of Xylourgos along with creepy curses and crazed occultists. But we know that, due to current world events, a lot of you are stuck at home and looking for something fun to do in the here and now. We wanted to do our part to bring a bit of extra entertainment to you and the entire Borderlands community, so we're starting a new event as of today: Takedown Shakedown, focusing on the Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite.

This event will begin via a hotfix later today, March 24, and will conclude via another hotfix on Friday, March 27 at 8:59 AM PT. During the Takedown Shakedown, the mini-boss and end boss encounters in the Maliwan Blacksite will have boosted drop chances for items from their dedicated loot pool. If you just recently jumped into Borderlands 3 following its Steam launch, please note that you'll need to finish Borderlands 3's main story campaign before you can unlock the mission granting access to the endgame challenge of Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite. Takedowns scale in difficulty depending on your party size, but are intended for max-level characters with powerful gear. If you're looking to really test your endgame abilities, you should step up to the True Takedown Mode with a full party of four Vault Hunters.

We'll be rolling out a series of similar mini-events in the coming weeks. Community feedback is hugely important to us, so please let us know what you think of the Takedown Shakedown. And don't forget the big April events we have planned: Mayhem 2.0 and the next seasonal event, Revenge of the Cartels, both of which are detailed in The Borderlands Show Episode 6. There's lots to look forward to, so be safe and stay strong!
