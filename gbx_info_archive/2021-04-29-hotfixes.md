Today’s changes to Borderlands 3 buff various pieces of end-game gear and address reported instances of the wrong Class Mod sometimes dropping for the Beastmaster and the Gunner in the Guns, Love, and Tentacles add-on.

As a reminder, Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine will be moving to a new location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a hotfix.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

- Made a change that makes the Class Mods for the Beastmaster and the Gunner drop for their respective characters more frequently in the Guns, Love, and Tentacles Add-on

Weapon Adjustments
------------------

We’re taking a pass on some gear obtained in higher Mayhem levels and the two Takedowns. Our goal is to provide a stairstep experience from Mayhem 4, to Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite, to Mayhem 6, to Takedown at the Guardian Breach. Players should feel a ramp of power through these changes as they tackle each piece of content. The following pieces of gear received a damage buff:
