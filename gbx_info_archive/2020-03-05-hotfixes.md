Vault Hunters:
--------------

This week, we took a look at some character skills that were occasionally not properly reporting what was happening in-game. For these instances, we have updated the description text to show the actual in-game values and removed an instance of a penalty that was not reported on its skill description.

- Addressed reported instances of the Gunner’s skill descriptions sometimes showing inaccurate values
  - “Hell on Rails” skill description was occasionally showing +30% Fuel Drain instead of the actual +8%
  - “Corrosive Sabot Round” skill description was occasionally showing -50% Railgun Damage and Fuel Drain instead of the actual -33%
- Addressed a reported concern that the Gunner’s “Active Tracking” skill was receiving a 50% penalty to damage per missile and ammo capacity that was not listed in the skill description. We have removed this penalty
- Fixed a typo with the Beastmaster’s “Furious Attack” skill in English
- Addressed a reported concern that Blood Cooled Jackbot’s beam attacks were bypassing the Operative’s barrier
