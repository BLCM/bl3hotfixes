Get more gear by playing with friends during the free Co-op Loot Drop event in Borderlands 3!

Those who slay together get paid together. With that adage in mind, we're bringing back the Co-op Loot Drop event! From December 17 at 9:00 AM PT to January 21 at 8:59 AM PT, all Badass enemies will drop more loot when you're playing co-op in online multiplayer or local split-screen. Plus, the more people you play with, the more loot that drops, making it the perfect time to boot up the new 4-player split-screen for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S!

That effect applies to all Badass enemies game-wide, including any you encounter in paid add-on content: Moxxi's Heist of The Handsome Jackpot, Guns, Love, and Tentacles: The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock, Bounty of Blood, Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck, and even Arms Race from Designer's Cut (albeit at a slightly lower bonus rate for balance purposes).

If you're playing with a new group of freshly minted Vault Hunters, this event is a great way to gear up quickly. Meanwhile, more seasoned slayers can take advantage of the boosted co-op rewards in challenging endgame content like Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite and Takedown at the Guardian Breach.

Whether you're quarantined with pals or socially distant gaming, the Co-op Loot Drop offers quality bonding time with a multitude of mayhem-filled moments.

Show those Badass enemies who's boss and reap the extra rewards before the event ends on January 21, 2021!
