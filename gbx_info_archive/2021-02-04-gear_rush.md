Today in Borderlands 3, we’re kicking off the last week of our Arms Race mini-events with Gear Rush! This mini-event is enabled by a hotfix that will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

During the Gear Rush mini-event, Rare Chests are more likely to appear in Arms Race, and the green DAHL chests located at major points of interest in the Stormblind Complex have an increased chance to contain Arms Race-exclusive gear. But make sure you don’t spend too long admiring the gear you find, because the Murdercane will be closing in at a quicker pace. This event will end on February 11 at 8:59 AM PT / 11:59 AM ET.

The Extra Extra Extraction mini-event in Arms Race will end at 8:59 AM PT with today’s hotfix.

- Activates the Gear Rush mini-event until February 11 at 8:59 AM PT.
