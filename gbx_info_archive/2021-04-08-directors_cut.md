Posted: Apr 8 2021

Today we will release an update and hotfixes for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. This update adds a whole lot of content for the Director’s Cut add-on, quality-of-life machines for the base game, and additional requests from the community! The full list of additions and changes is below:

Update Notes
============

New Content Included in Director’s Cut:
---------------------------------------

**Added support for the new Raid Boss: Hemovorous the Invincible**

- Hemovorous has made her lair behind a previously sealed door on Pandora, and Director’s Cut is your chance to go toe-to-pincer with this monstrous enemy!
- To take on Hemovorous, players will need to complete the main story campaign and own the Director’s Cut content. You will receive the raid mission from inside Claptrap’s closet on Sanctuary III. It will cost 500 Eridium for your group to open the door, giving you the opportunity for new loot if you succeed.

**Added support for Ava’s Murder Mysteries**

- Ava is convinced she has a lead on some potentially supernatural slayings and has decided to document her findings in serialized podcast form. Consider yourself her gun-toting co-host as you investigate strange happenings on Pandora, Promethea, Eden-6, and Nekrotafeyo in search of answers (and loot) with the help of some familiar faces.

**Added Behind-the-Scenes Content**

- A new menu option is available to Director’s Cut owners! Explore a gallery full of concept art, storyboards, lost maps, and footage from throughout the game’s development—including a very special animatic for Maya that wasn’t able to make it to Borderlands 3.

**Added support for Vault Cards and their rewards, and implements the first Vault Card of three**

- Vault Cards are a new challenge-based progression system in Borderlands 3 that will unlock a bevy of themed cosmetics plus some supremely powerful gear that scales to your level.
- The Vault Cards will have three Daily Challenges and one multi-tiered Weekly Challenge each.
- The Daily Challenges will reset at 9:00 AM PT every day and the Weekly Challenges will reset at 9:00 AM PT every Thursday

New Content for Designer’s Cut & Season Pass 2:
-----------------------------------------------

- Added four new pieces of gear to Arms Race for players with the Designer’s Cut
- Added the Disciples of the Vault cosmetic packs for players with Season Pass 2
  - Each character-specific Disciples of the Vault pack includes a one-of-a-kind Vault Hunter Body and matching Head, which you can mix and match with any other customization options you have in your collection.

New Base Game Content
---------------------

**Added support for the Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine**

- Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine is offering different top-tier Legendary loot that will be hiding in a new location each week (excluding DLC maps)
- This vending machine will relocate at 9:00 AM PT every Thursday

**Added support for Crazy Earl’s Reroll Machine**

- For 250 Eridium, you will be able to reroll an existing Anointment on any piece of gear—but beware: you can’t take it back once you’ve rerolled your Anointment!
- This machine will be permanently located near Crazy Earl on Sanctuary III

**Opened the Diamond Armory on Sanctuary III**

- Located under the Bridge on Sanctuary III, the Diamond Armory opens a whole room of loot
- The room is activated with the use of a Diamond Key, which are rare rewards that can be obtained through Vault Cards!

  - “Critical Mass” is a new class mod in Director’s Cut; the name was switched along the way somewhere and this change corrects that!
- Updated the HOT Spring Legendary grenade from the Designer’s Cut to show correct textures
- Addressed a reported issue that was causing downed players to stay in FFYL after being revived in Arms Race
- Addressed a reported issue that was causing skill points gained during Arms Race to not be granted properly

- Addressed noticeable hitching throughout the game when players were engaged in heavy battle
- Updated timed events to grant current event rewards if the player played the previous year
