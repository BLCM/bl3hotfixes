Posted: Jan 21 2021

Today we will release an update for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. This update addresses some concerns reported by the community.

In addition to today’s update, we are activating three weeks of Arms Race mini-events! The first mini-event, Clear Skies, begins with today’s hotfixes. During the Clear Skies mini-event, all enemies will have a chance to drop better loot and the Murdercane’s circle will take longer to close in so you have precious extra time to scavenge and explore. As a reminder, the Co-op Loot Drop event will be ending today at 8:59 AM PT.
