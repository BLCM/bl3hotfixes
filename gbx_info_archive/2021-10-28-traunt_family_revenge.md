The Traunt Family has hijacked this week's Borderlands 3 changes, and they're looking for REVENGE for what you did as part of Maurice's Community Carnage Challenges. How DARE you all take them down so quickly! They're fueled by rage and ready to return the favor. We expect them to calm down on November 4 at 8:59 AM PT.

- When playing in Mayhem Mode or True Vault Hunter Mode, Captain Traunt, General Traunt, and Captain Haunt will have health and damage numbers rivaling that of a raid boss. If you manage to put them back in the ground, you'll have a greatly increased chance of getting their best loot. This limited-time event ends November 4 at 8:59 AM PT
- Bloody Harvest gear has been spread into each of the Traunts' loot pools until November 4 at 8:59 AM PT

The current Community Carnage Challenge "Long-Distance Relations" is still being counted during the event!

Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine will also be moving to a new location on Thursdays at 9:00 AM PT / 12:00 PM ET and is activated with a hotfix.

These changes will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PT. To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that reads, “Hotfixes Applied!” If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.
