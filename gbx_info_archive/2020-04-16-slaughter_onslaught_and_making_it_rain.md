Posted: Apr 16 2020

Today we will release a hotfix for Borderlands 3, which will be live on all platforms by 12:00 PM PST. In this week’s hotfixes we have two new mini-events: Mr. Torgue’s Slaughter Onslaught and Making it Rain! To apply hotfixes, wait at the main menu until you see a sign that says “Hotfixes Applied”! If you are experiencing any issues or want to provide feedback, please submit a ticket to support.2k.com.

**Rare Chest Riches and Loot Monster Mayhem mini-events end at 9:00 AM PST today.**

The Co-Op Loot Drop event is continuing until April 30!

This week, we have two new mini-events: Mr. Torgue’s Slaughter Onslaught and Making It Rain! Mr. Torgue’s Slaughter Onslaught will increase the number of dedicated loot drops from Slaughter bosses. The Making It Rain event will increase the in-game currency Cash drops for normal, Badass, and Anointed enemies, which will come in handy when you’re fighting the Cartels in this month’s upcoming patch. These events will go live with the hotfix today and will end on April 23 at 9:00 AM PT.

There are no balance adjustments this week. We wanted to take this time to let the dust settle after the balance adjustments that were made over the previous weeks and are continuing to monitor and collect feedback based on those changes.

- Activate Mr. Torgue’s Slaughter Onslaught mini-event until 9:00 AM PT on April 23
- Activate Making It Rain mini-event until 9:00 AM PT on April 23
- Addressed a reported concern that Phasegrasp was not supported on Nekrotafeyo
