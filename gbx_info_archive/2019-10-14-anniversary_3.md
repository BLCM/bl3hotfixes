We're continuing to celebrate Borderlands' 10-year anniversary with another week of in-game bonuses for Borderlands 3. This week is Show Me the Eridium!

The first thing to know about Crazy Earl—besides the fact that he's completely off his rocker—is that he prizes the ancient purple element known as Eridium over all else. During this week's Borderlands Anniversary Celebration event, entitled Show Me the Eridium, you can make Crazy Earl envious of your Eridium reserves once the strange ore starts popping up all over the place. And if you don't feel like hoarding all that precious Eridium to yourself, Crazy Earl style, he'll gladly trade you for cosmetic items and Anointed weapons in exchange for your stash.

The Show Me the Eridium event will begin courtesy of a quick micropatch deploying by or before 3:00 PM PDT on Tuesday, October 15. You'll receive an in-game notification if you're playing while the micropatch goes live; to ensure that the micropatch is successfully applied, verify that you're online then hang around the main menu for a minute or two. For the duration of this event, there will be Eridium drops added to standard enemies, increased Eridium drops in Mayhem Mode, discounted Eridium costs to use Moxxi's Vault Line slot machine, and a discount on all the coveted items at Crazy Earl's hideout in the Cargo Bay of Sanctuary III.

In case you haven't done business with Crazy Earl before, he's the only vendor who deals in Eridium, the special currency earned exclusively through gameplay. Provided you're packing enough Eridium shards, he'll sell you all kinds of cosmetic items big and small: Vault Hunter Heads and Skins, Emotes, ECHO themes, Trinkets, Weapon Skins, and Room Decorations. Next to his little bunker, you'll find his custom-built Veteran Rewards vending machine, which takes Eridium in exchange for Anointed weapons. Anointed gear is powerful thanks to its ability to improve Action Skills in ways that may or may not be specific to one Vault Hunter.

Show Me the Eridium will run from October 15 to October 22 when the next week's theme begins. The Borderlands Anniversary Celebration calendar is below—and if you want to know what this month of Borderlands 3 bonuses is all about, you can catch up here.

- Week 3 (October 15-22): Show Me the Eridium!
- Week 4 (October 22-29): Mayhem on Twitch!
- Week 5 (October 29 - November 4): Spooky Surprise!

This week is the ideal time to collect Borderlands 3's wide assortment of cosmetics, giving your Vault Hunter everything they need to positively slay when it comes to fashion and flair. Those Anointed weapons will also provide a nice boost in power—and if you somehow amass more Eridium than you know what to do with, show off how big of a baller you are by firing weapons from the Eridian Fabricator with reckless abandon.
